This assignment was very fun! I was a bit disappointed that the colors I chose on QT didnt show up when I opened 
the file on the terminal. Working with QT was definitely a challenge. The documentation is a bit confusing 
but it was nice to have code to base a skeleton on. 
To future students: 
There is alot of research to be done when it comes to python and QT. The most difficult part of this assignment was connecting 
the UI file and py file. It kept giving me issues and would not run. Overall, i'd say it was fun to design on QT and not have to use 
CSS and HTML.
